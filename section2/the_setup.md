# The Setup

Download and install R http://cran.r-project.org/ and RStudio http://www.rstudio.com/ if you do not have them already. Rstudio is optional but it is a great tool if you are just starting to learn R.
You will need specific data sets to run the codes in this document. Download the data.zip[URL to come] and extract it to your directory of choice. The folder name should be “data” and your R working directory should be level above the data folder. That means in your R console, when you type “dir(“data”)” you should be able to see the contents of the data folder. You can change your working directory by setwd() command and get your current working directory with getwd() command in R2. In RStudio, you can click on the top menu and change the location of your working directory via user interface.
